Divide all elements of a matrix by a given number.

Args:
	matrix (list of lists): The input matrix containing integers or floats.
        div (int or float): The number to divide the matrix elements by.

Returns:
	list of lists: A new matrix where each element is the result of dividing the
                       corresponding element from the input matrix by the given div,
                       rounded to 2 decimal places.

Raises:
	TypeError: If the input matrix is not a valid matrix (list of lists of integers/floats),
                   or if the div is not a number.
        TypeError: If each row of the matrix does not have the same size.
        ZeroDivisionError: If div is equal to zero.
